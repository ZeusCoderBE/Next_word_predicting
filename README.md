#Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project

## Introduce

### Environment setup
1. **Install Python libraries:** `numpy`,`tensorflow`,`scikit-learn`, `pandas`.
2. **Dataset:**
- Text data is used from "Speech of the Rector of Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education at the ceremony celebrating 50 years of Vietnam-Germany relations"

### Implemented NLP algorithm
1. **Token and preprocessing:**
     - Preprocessing: I implemented data preprocessing steps, including sentence extraction, word dictionary generation, and input sequence generation using the n-gram method.
2. **Word Embed:**
     - Use the wordembedding layer to reduce the representation of a word vector.
     - Represent words in a multidimensional vector space to capture semantic relationships.

3. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):**
     - Implemented RNN-based models for string prediction or text generation tasks.
     - Used architectures like SimpleRNN to capture temporal dependencies in text data.

### Libraries and Technology
- **Programming language:** Python
- **Main libraries:** NumPy, scikit-learn, pandas, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Sample:** Word embedding, RNN

### Performance evaluation
- Used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the performance of NLP models on the test set.

### Oriented development
- Complete a simple chatbot.

### Conclusion
- This project provides an overview of different NLP techniques and how to implement them for text processing and analysis. The models were trained and evaluated on real-world text data to ensure their effectiveness in handling natural language tasks.
